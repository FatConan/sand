# Sand

**Sand** is a static site generator based heavily on an early version of [Stone](https://github.com/neuralsandwich/stone) by
[NeuralSandwich](https://github.com/neuralsandwich). While **Stone** is becoming a more fully featured blog engine, Sand
pairs back functionality to the basics and is designed to provide similar functionality to the these early versions of stone 
with added wildcard support, support for resources, and some other functions that proved useful for building some other
projects it had been used for.
