# Sand : A simple static site generator

**Sand** is a static site generator based heavily on an early version of [Stone](https://github.com/neuralsandwich/stone) by
[NeuralSandwich](https://github.com/neuralsandwich). While **Stone** is becoming a more fully featured blog engine, **Sand**
pairs back functionality to the basics, and is designed to provide similar functionality to the early versions of stone, but 
with added wildcard support, support for resources, and some other functions that proved useful when building projects.
